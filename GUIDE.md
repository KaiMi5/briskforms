##BriskForms Guide

###What is BriskForms?

BriskForms provides a fast and secure mechanism by which to keep in touch with your visitors while protecting your privacy and keeping spammers away.

With no registration required, adding a BriskForm to your site or app has never been easier. 

###Getting Started

We ask just three simple questions.

####1. Where they at?

Tell us where your visitors will be coming from.

####2. Where you at?

Tell us where to send your form submissions.

> A confirmation link will be sent to this address following setup.

####3. Do what now?

We can't just leave your visitors hanging! Tell us where you want them sent next.
> Use the optional failure URL to tell your users how much they suck.

###Setting up your BriskForm

Upon submission of your configuration information, you'll be supplied with a secure URL to place in your form's ```action``` attribute.

**Example**: 

```<form action="http://briskforms.com/blahblah">```

> **Important:** the address you used in step 2 must be confirmed via a confirmation link before your BriskForm will be active.

####*And that's it.*
We'll take it form here.
